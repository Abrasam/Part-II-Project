	\section{Status of Project}
	Overall, my project is progressing roughly according to plan, with a few minor deviations. I am approximately keeping up with my timetable, though there is one item which I have not completed. The item in question is the small test client which will be fairly easy to implement. This has not yet been needed and I've spent more time testing and debugging the rest of the project first before I move onto more formal evaluation.
